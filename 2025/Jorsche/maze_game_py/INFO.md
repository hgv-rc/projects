# Maze Game by Jorsche Dylan
This is a game in which you spawn in as a player who will have to navigate through a maze to reach an end target. You will take on the camera perspective of a bird's eye view of the entire maze, and you will have to use WASD to manoeuvre through the labyrinth. Beware of the turns though, you may get stuck!

This project was featured on Hillgrove Robotics Club's 2024 and 2023 Outreach and Openhouse programmes, where it was well-received by its audience.
